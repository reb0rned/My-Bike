# My Bike Landing Page

## Project Description  
This is a landing page designed for **My Bike**, featuring a clean and modern layout that highlights urban cycling products and lifestyle. The design focuses on simplicity and responsiveness, with sections such as Featured Bikes, Accessories, About Us, and Contact.  

Built using a base layout template with Gulp and SCSS, the page ensures optimized performance and well-structured, maintainable styles using the BEM methodology. Interactive elements such as the navigation menu and contact form are implemented using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **SCSS** â€“ For modular styling with BEM methodology  
- **Gulp** â€“ For task automation: SCSS compilation, minification, and live reload
